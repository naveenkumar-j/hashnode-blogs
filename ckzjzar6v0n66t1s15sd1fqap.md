**Q2.Develop all the production rules for the following water jug problem:
You are given two jugs, 4-litre one and 3-litre one. Neither has any measuring marks on it. There is a pump that can be used to fill the jugs with water. How can we get exactly 2 litres of water into 4-litre jug?**

**Q2 answer: **

The state space for this problem can be described as the set of ordered pairs of integers (x,y) such that x=0,1,2,3 or 4 and y=0,1,2 or 3.
Here x represents the number of litres of water in the 4-litre jug
and y represents the number of litres of water in the 3-litre jug.
The start state or initial state = (0,0)
The goal state = (2,y)
